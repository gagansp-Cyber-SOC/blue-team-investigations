## IDENTIFICATION & QUICK RESPONSE (SOC PLAYBOOK)

---

## 🧠 WHAT DOES “MASS ACTIVITY” MEAN

Mass activity means
➡️ Abnormally high number of file actions
➡️ Within a short time window
➡️ By a single user, host, or IP

### Types

• Mass delete
• Mass upload
• Mass download

Normal users do few actions slowly
Attackers or automated tools do many actions fast

---

## 🧠 DATA SOURCES WHERE THIS IS DETECTED

Mass activity alerts come from
• DLP / Proxy / CASB (Netskope, Zscaler)
• Cloud apps (O365, Google Drive, SharePoint)
• EDR (local file deletion)
• File servers / NAS
• SIEM correlation rules

---

## 🧠 1️⃣ MASS DOWNLOAD — IDENTIFICATION

### 🔹 WHAT IT USUALLY MEANS

Possible causes
• Data exfiltration
• Insider theft
• Compromised account
• Ransomware staging

---

### 📍 WHERE YOU SEE IT

• CASB / Proxy logs
• Cloud audit logs
• DLP alerts

---

### 🔴 MALICIOUS LOG EXAMPLE (CLOUD)

```
User: gagan@company.com
Action: FileDownload
Application: OneDrive
Files Downloaded: 3,250
Time Window: 8 minutes
Source IP: 185.231.154.22
User Agent: curl/7.68.0
```

❌ WHY MALICIOUS
• Too many files
• Very short time
• External IP
• Non-browser user agent

➡️ Likely data theft

---

### 🟢 LEGIT EXAMPLE

```
User: backup.service@company.com
Action: FileDownload
Files Downloaded: 1,500
Duration: 3 hours
Source IP: Internal
```

✔ Service account
✔ Expected job
✔ Long duration

---

### 🧠 QUICK RESPONSE — MASS DOWNLOAD

1️⃣ Suspend user session
2️⃣ Block external IP
3️⃣ Disable account temporarily
4️⃣ Check what files were accessed
5️⃣ Check upload activity after download

---

## 🧠 2️⃣ MASS UPLOAD — IDENTIFICATION

### 🔹 WHAT IT USUALLY MEANS

Possible causes
• Data exfiltration to personal cloud
• Malware uploading stolen data
• Insider sharing data

---

### 📍 WHERE YOU SEE IT

• Proxy / CASB
• DLP tools
• Cloud audit logs

---

### 🔴 MALICIOUS LOG EXAMPLE (PROXY / CASB)

```
User: gagan@company.com
Action: FileUpload
Destination App: Dropbox (Personal)
Files Uploaded: 820
Total Size: 4.2 GB
Time Window: 6 minutes
```

❌ WHY MALICIOUS
• Personal cloud
• Large volume
• Short time
• No business justification

---

### 🟢 LEGIT EXAMPLE

```
User: project.team@company.com
Action: FileUpload
Destination App: SharePoint
Files Uploaded: 120
Duration: 2 hours
```

✔ Corporate app
✔ Normal pace
✔ Expected behavior

---

### 🧠 QUICK RESPONSE — MASS UPLOAD

1️⃣ Block upload action immediately
2️⃣ Revoke active sessions
3️⃣ Disable account (if suspicious)
4️⃣ Preserve logs (legal / audit)
5️⃣ Inform data owner / GRC

---

## 🧠 3️⃣ MASS DELETE — IDENTIFICATION

### 🔹 WHAT IT USUALLY MEANS

Possible causes
• Ransomware pre-encryption
• Insider sabotage
• Compromised admin account

---

### 📍 WHERE YOU SEE IT

• EDR
• File server logs
• Cloud audit logs

---

### 🔴 MALICIOUS LOG EXAMPLE (FILE SERVER)

```
User: CORP\gagan
Action: Delete
Files Deleted: 18,450
Location: \\fileserver\Finance\
Time Window: 4 minutes
```

❌ WHY MALICIOUS
• Massive volume
• Very fast
• Sensitive folder

---

### 🔴 MALICIOUS LOG EXAMPLE (EDR)

```
Process: encryptor.exe
Action: FileDelete
Files Affected: 12,000
Directory: C:\Users\
```

➡️ Ransomware indicator

---

### 🟢 LEGIT EXAMPLE

```
User: admin.backup
Action: Delete
Files Deleted: 500
Purpose: Cleanup old backups
Duration: 2 hours
```

✔ Admin task
✔ Documented
✔ Controlled pace

---

### 🧠 QUICK RESPONSE — MASS DELETE

1️⃣ Isolate affected host immediately
2️⃣ Stop deletion process
3️⃣ Disable user account
4️⃣ Protect backups
5️⃣ Alert management

---

## 🧠 HOW SOC DECIDES LEGIT vs MALICIOUS (KEY LOGIC)

Ask these questions 👇

✔ Who is the user (human vs service)
✔ From where (internal vs external IP)
✔ How fast (minutes vs hours)
✔ What tool (browser vs script)
✔ What data (public vs sensitive)

If **2–3 answers look wrong**
➡️ Treat as security incident

---

## 🧠 COMMON ATTACK SCENARIOS (REAL WORLD)

### 🔴 Scenario 1 — Phishing → Data Theft

• Account compromised
• Mass download from OneDrive
• Upload to personal Dropbox

### 🔴 Scenario 2 — Insider Threat

• Employee resigning
• Downloads entire project
• Deletes shared folders

### 🔴 Scenario 3 — Ransomware

• Mass delete shadow copies
• Mass file rename / encrypt
• Followed by ransom note

---

## 🧠 WHAT NOT TO DO (VERY IMPORTANT)

❌ Ignore because “user is trusted”
❌ Assume backup job without validation
❌ Close alert without checking IP + user agent
❌ Delay response (minutes matter)

---

## 🧠 ONE-LINE SOC RESPONSE STATEMENT

> “Mass file activity was detected based on an abnormal volume of file operations within a short time window, indicating potential data exfiltration or destructive activity. Immediate containment actions were taken to prevent further data loss.”

---

## 🧠 QUICK MEMORY CHEAT

Mass activity =
• Volume
• Speed
• Sensitivity
• Context

Not just “number of files”
