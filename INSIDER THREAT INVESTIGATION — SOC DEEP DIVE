### 🧠 1️⃣ WHAT IS AN INSIDER THREAT (SOC VIEW)

🔸 Insider ≠ always malicious  
🔸 Insider threat can be:

- 🔹 Malicious insider (intentional data theft/sabotage)  
- 🔹 Negligent insider (careless actions)  
- 🔹 Compromised insider (account taken over)

⚠️ **SOC rule**  
🔸 Treat behavior, not the person, as suspicious  

---

### 🧠 2️⃣ WHEN SHOULD SOC SUSPECT INSIDER THREAT

🚩 **COMMON TRIGGERS**

- 🔹 Unusual data access/download  
- 🔹 Access outside job role  
- 🔹 After-hours activity  
- 🔹 USB / cloud upload spike  
- 🔹 Emailing data to personal account  
- 🔹 Accessing systems before resignation  
- 🔹 VPN login from unusual location  

---

### 🧠 3️⃣ SOC MINDSET BEFORE STARTING

🔍 Ask these before touching tools:

- 🔹 Is this new behavior for this user?  
- 🔹 Is this role-appropriate access?  
- 🔹 Is there a business reason?  
- 🔹 Is activity repeated or one-time?  
- 🔹 Is there data movement involved?  

🧠 Insider threat = pattern over time, not one alert  

---

### 🧠 4️⃣ PRIMARY DATA SOURCES (DO NOT SKIP)

📊 **Source → Purpose**

- 🔹 Identity (AD / IdP) → Who accessed  
- 🔹 EDR → What ran  
- 🔹 DLP → What data moved  
- 🔹 Email → Where data went  
- 🔹 Cloud logs → SaaS abuse  
- 🔹 File server logs → What files  
- 🔹 VPN logs → Where from  

---

### 🧠 5️⃣ IDENTITY & AUTHENTICATION CHECK (FIRST STEP)

📍 **WHERE TO LOOK**

- 🔹 Active Directory  
- 🔹 Azure AD / Google Workspace  

🔍 **WHAT TO CHECK**

- 🔹 Login time  
- 🔹 Login location  
- 🔹 MFA status  
- 🔹 New device/browser  
- 🔹 Privilege changes  

🪟 **WINDOWS EVENT IDs**

- 🔹 4624 – Successful logon  
- 🔹 4625 – Failed logon  
- 🔹 4672 – Privileged logon  
- 🔹 4728 – Added to privileged group  
- 🔹 4732 – Added to local admin  

❓ **QUESTIONS TO ASK**

- 🔹 Login during non-working hours?  
- 🔹 VPN + office login overlap?  
- 🔹 Recent role change?  

---

### 🧠 6️⃣ ENDPOINT (EDR) INVESTIGATION

💡 **WHY EDR IS CRITICAL**

- 🔹 Insiders rarely drop malware  
- 🔹 Legit tools are abused  

🔍 **WHAT TO CHECK**

- 🔹 Process tree  
- 🔹 Command line  
- 🔹 File access  
- 🔹 USB activity  
- 🔹 Archive creation  

🚨 **RED FLAG COMMANDS**

- 🔹 powershell Compress-Archive  
- 🔹 robocopy / xcopy  
- 🔹 rar.exe / 7z.exe  
- 🔹 scp / winscp  

📁 **SUSPICIOUS PATHS**

- 🔹 `C:\Users\<user>\Downloads`  
- 🔹 `C:\Users\<user>\Desktop`  
- 🔹 `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming`  

---

### 🧠 7️⃣ FILE SERVER / SHARE ACCESS

📍 **WHERE TO LOOK**

- 🔹 Windows File Server logs  
- 🔹 NAS audit logs  

🔍 **WHAT TO CHECK**

- 🔹 Mass file access  
- 🔹 Unrelated folder access  
- 🔹 Copy vs read behavior  

🪟 **WINDOWS EVENT IDs**

- 🔹 4663 – Object access  
- 🔹 5140 – Network share access  

🚩 **RED FLAGS**

- 🔹 HR/Finance access  
- 🔹 High-volume reads  
- 🔹 Pre-resignation access  

---

### 🧠 8️⃣ DLP INVESTIGATION (MOST IMPORTANT)

📦 **WHAT DLP SHOWS**

- 🔹 What data  
- 🔹 Where it went  
- 🔹 How it left  

🚚 **COMMON EXFIL PATHS**

- 🔹 Cloud storage  
- 🔹 Email attachments  
- 🔹 USB  
- 🔹 Web uploads  

⚠️ One violation = warning  
🚨 Repeated violations = insider pattern  

---

### 🧠 9️⃣ EMAIL INVESTIGATION

📧 **WHAT TO CHECK**

- 🔹 Attachments  
- 🔹 Forwarding rules  
- 🔹 External recipients  

🚩 **RED FLAGS**

- 🔹 Password-protected archives  
- 🔹 Draft-only emails  
- 🔹 Auto-forwarding  

---

### 🧠 🔟 CLOUD / SAAS LOGS

☁️ **WHAT TO CHECK**

- 🔹 Mass downloads  
- 🔹 API usage  
- 🔹 Sharing links  
- 🔹 Unmanaged devices  

🚩 **RED FLAGS**

- 🔹 Entire drive downloads  
- 🔹 Public sharing enabled  
- 🔹 After-hours access  

---

### 🧠 1️⃣1️⃣ USB & REMOVABLE MEDIA

🔌 **EVENTS**

- 🔹 Event ID 2003 – USB inserted  
- 🔹 Event ID 4663 – File copied  

❓ **QUESTIONS**

- 🔹 USB policy allowed?  
- 🔹 New device?  
- 🔹 Encryption used?  

---

### 🧠 1️⃣2️⃣ BEHAVIORAL CORRELATION (KEY STEP)

🧩 Correlate:

- 🔹 Identity + EDR + DLP + Email + Cloud  

📌 **Example Pattern**

- 🔹 Late login  
- 🔹 Finance access  
- 🔹 File compression  
- 🔹 Personal cloud upload  
- 🔹 Resignation email  

🚨 Insider threat confirmed  

---

### 🧠 1️⃣3️⃣ WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ Don’t accuse  
❌ Don’t alert user  
❌ Don’t rely on one alert  
❌ Don’t block unless active exfil  

🛡️ SOC = evidence collection  

---

### 🧠 1️⃣4️⃣ ESCALATION & HANDOFF

🚨 **ESCALATE WHEN**

- 🔹 Confirmed data movement  
- 🔹 Repeated violations  
- 🔹 Privilege abuse  

👥 **STAKEHOLDERS**

- 🔹 SOC Lead  
- 🔹 Legal  
- 🔹 HR  
- 🔹 GRC

### 🧠 1️⃣5️⃣ DOCUMENTATION

📝 Report must include:

- 🔹 Timeline
