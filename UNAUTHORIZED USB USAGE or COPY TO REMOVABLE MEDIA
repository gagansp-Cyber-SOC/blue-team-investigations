# 🔌📀 UNAUTHORIZED USB USAGE / COPY TO REMOVABLE MEDIA

## COMPLETE SOC INVESTIGATION PLAYBOOK

---

## 🧠📘 WHAT THIS ALERT REALLY MEANS

Unauthorized USB usage indicates that **data was accessed, copied, or attempted to be copied** from a corporate endpoint to a **removable storage device** such as:

• USB flash drives
• External hard disks
• SD cards
• Mobile phones in storage mode

🚨 This alert does **NOT automatically mean malicious activity**
🚨 But it always represents **data loss risk**
🚨 USB is a **top insider-threat and exfiltration vector**

---

## 🚨 WHY THIS ALERT IS HIGH RISK

• Data leaves the corporate boundary silently
• No network logs required (offline exfiltration)
• Often bypasses CASB, proxy, firewall
• Used in insider theft and pre-resignation cases
• Used by attackers when network exfiltration is blocked

Once data is copied to USB, **recovery is impossible**

---

## ⏱️📏 SLA — WHEN TO INVESTIGATE

🚨 Sensitive data + USB copy → **Immediate (≤ 1 hour)**
⚠️ Non-sensitive data → **Same business day**

Delay increases **legal, compliance, and IP loss impact**

---

## 🧭🕐 PHASE 1 — ALERT INTAKE & VALIDATION

### ❓🧠 WHY THIS PHASE MATTERS

USB alerts are noisy due to:
• IT support usage
• Backup operations
• Legitimate file transfers

If you don’t validate early:
❌ You escalate IT work
❌ Or miss insider theft

---

### 📍🔎 WHERE THIS ALERT COMES FROM

• DLP endpoint agent
• EDR device control
• OS security logs
• SIEM correlation rules

---

### 📋🔍 WHAT TO CONFIRM IMMEDIATELY

👤 Username → who copied data
💻 Hostname → which endpoint
🔌 USB device ID → which device
📂 Files copied → what data
🏷️ Data type → PII / PCI / PHI / IP
⏰ Time → business vs off-hours
⚙️ Process → explorer, cmd, script

---

### 🧪📄 SAMPLE USB ALERT (REALISTIC)

```
Alert: Copy to Removable Media
User: CORP\gagan
Host: LAPTOP-17
Device: SanDisk USB 3.2
Serial: 4C530001230412345
Files Copied: 145
Total Size: 2.3 GB
Classification: PII
Time: 22:41 IST
```

🚩 Off-hours + sensitive data = escalation trigger

---

## 🔌📀 PHASE 2 — USB DEVICE IDENTIFICATION

### ❓🧠 WHY DEVICE DETAILS MATTER

Identifying the device tells you:
• Personal vs corporate USB
• Repeated usage
• Evidence for HR / legal

---

### 📍📂 WHERE TO LOOK (WINDOWS)

**Registry**

```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR
```

**Mounted devices**

```
HKLM\SYSTEM\MountedDevices
```

---

### 💻🔍 COMMANDS TO CHECK USB HISTORY

```
reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR
```

```
wmic logicaldisk where "drivetype=2" get DeviceID,VolumeName
```

---

### 🧪📄 SAMPLE USB ENUMERATION

```
USBSTOR\Disk&Ven_SanDisk&Prod_Ultra&Rev_1.00
SerialNumber: 4C530001230412345
```

🚩 Unknown USB serial = personal device

---

## 📂🧠 PHASE 3 — FILE & DATA ANALYSIS (WHAT WAS COPIED)

### ❓🧠 WHY THIS PHASE EXISTS

Volume alone is meaningless
**Data sensitivity defines severity**

---

### 📍📂 WHERE TO LOOK

• DLP file evidence
• Endpoint file access logs
• EDR telemetry

---

### 🪟 WINDOWS FILE ACCESS LOG (4663)

📍 Path

```
Event Viewer
→ Windows Logs
→ Security
```

📄 Log file

```
C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Security.evtx
```

---

### 🧪📄 SAMPLE FILE ACCESS LOG

```
Event ID: 4663
Object Name: C:\Users\gagan\Documents\Finance\Payroll.xlsx
Access Mask: ReadData
Process Name: explorer.exe
```

🚩 Sensitive folder read before USB copy = staging

---

## ⚙️🖥️ PHASE 4 — PROCESS & TOOL ATTRIBUTION

### ❓🧠 WHY THIS MATTERS

How files were copied tells intent:
• Manual drag-drop
• Automated script
• Malware

---

### 📍📂 WHERE TO LOOK

• EDR process tree
• Event ID 4688

---

### 🧪📄 SAMPLE PROCESS LOG

```
Event ID: 4688
Process: explorer.exe
Parent: explorer.exe
Command Line: C:\Windows\explorer.exe
```

🟢 Typical manual copy

---

### 🔴 SUSPICIOUS PROCESS EXAMPLE

```
Process: powershell.exe
Command Line: Copy-Item C:\Users\gagan\Documents\* E:\ -Recurse
```

🚩 Scripted copy = high risk

---

## ⏰🌙 PHASE 5 — TIME & BEHAVIOR CONTEXT

### ❓🧠 WHY TIME MATTERS

Most insider activity happens:
• Late night
• Weekends
• After resignation notice

---

### 📋🔍 WHAT TO CHECK

⏰ Time of activity
📅 User notice period
📊 Historical USB usage

---

### 🧪📄 BEHAVIORAL RED FLAG

```
Normal USB usage: None
Current activity: 2.3 GB at 22:41
```

🚩 First-time USB usage + data copy = insider risk

---

## 🔁🧠 PHASE 6 — CORRELATION & FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITY

### ❓🧠 WHY CORRELATION IS REQUIRED

USB copy is often followed by:
• Email forwarding
• Cloud uploads
• Account resignation

---

### 📍📂 WHAT TO CORRELATE

• Login events (4624)
• Email activity
• Cloud uploads
• Prior DLP alerts

---

## ⚖️🚨 PHASE 7 — CLASSIFICATION & DECISION

### 📊🧠 DECISION LOGIC

| Scenario                      | Verdict        |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Corporate USB + approved task | Benign         |
| Non-sensitive files           | Monitor        |
| Sensitive data + personal USB | Incident       |
| Repeat USB usage              | Insider threat |
| Scripted copy                 | Incident       |

---

## 🛠️🚨 PHASE 8 — RESPONSE ACTIONS

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

⛔ Block USB device
🔐 Disable user account (if required)
📦 Preserve logs & evidence
🧾 Notify data owner

---

### 🚨 IF CONFIRMED INCIDENT

🔑 Force password reset
📣 Notify HR / Legal / Compliance
🔍 Full endpoint investigation
📄 Regulatory assessment

---

## 🧠🔥 FINAL SOC TRUTH

🔌 USB exfiltration is **silent and fast**
📀 Legitimate access does **not mean legitimate intent**
👤 Context defines guilt
⏱️ Once data is copied, loss is permanent

> **Unauthorized USB usage is not an IT issue —
> it is a data security incident until proven otherwise.**
