# Blue Team Investigations

This repository documents security alert investigations from a defensive (Blue Team / SOC) perspective.

The focus is on:
- How SOC analysts think during investigations
- Where to look first for evidence
- Which logs, paths, and commands to check
- How to differentiate false positives from real incidents
- Attacker perspective vs normal behaviour
